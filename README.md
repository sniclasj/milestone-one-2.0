## Python Terminal Info

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

## Step 1
The first step was to create index.html and load in the Bootstrap CDN located at (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/#bootstrapcdn).

I then created the assets, css and images folder before creating the style.css file within the css folder.
I also imported some Google Fonts into the style.css sheet.

At this point, I decided to test my style.css file and came across my first issue. It didn't seem as if the styles applied within style.css were being applied to the web-page.

To resolve this, I inspected the code and realised that the issue was due to a typo in the header where I had typed 'stylsheet' instead of 'stylesheet' PUT IN SCREENSHOT OF THIS.

Once I validated that the style sheet was working, I utilised the Bootstrap Grid to create three responsive columns within a container. I gave the container a class of 'section-one'.

## Step 2
I then created another container and placed this above the 'section-one' container to create a navbar for the website with an id pf header. The navbar consisted of a branded logo to the left of the page and three links to the right of the page, namely, Home, Pricing and Join Us.

## Step 3
I wanted to place a 'hero image' between the navbar and section-one so I utilised and modified the following code (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12393382/positioning-text-relative-to-an-image-when-the-image-size-changes) to ensure the content overlayed on the image would re-size relative to the screensize/viewport. STRUGGLING TO GET THIS TO WORK!

## Step 4
I then created another bootstrap container which contained three responsive columns with an id of 'footer'.

## Step 5
I replicated the container containing three columns layout utilised in index.html for pricing.html however the background colour for each column has a different level of transparency to highlight the different pricing tiers.

## Step 6
I created a container on the 'join-us' page and placed a form within a Bootstrap col-12. The form has four required inputs (one of which is a dropdown) and two buttons (submit and restet).
I utilised and modified the following code to create a placeholder for my dropdown list (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5805059/how-do-i-make-a-placeholder-for-a-select-box) and I have populated the 'action' section of my form with the following url (https://formdump.codeinstitute.net).

- __The Pricing Page__

  - The pricing page has a brief explanation at the top of the page below the navigation bar which also contains a hyperlink to the Join Us page so that the user can immediately navigate to sign up.

The information on different tiers is concisely summarised via the use of bullet points so that the user is not overloaded with too much information regarding the membership types.
  - The membership tiers and bullet points are positioned in such a way that it is clear to see what is omitted as the pricing tier decreases which makes comparison of membership tiers easier for the user. This is also a strategy to increase the gym's revenue by convincing prospective clients to sign up for the top tier as they can see that the top ties does provide more for their money when comparing membership options.

### Features Left to Implement

- A future feature to implement would be the embedding of fitness related videos which loop on all pages as opposed to the Join Us page only.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to social media sites (facebook, twitter, instagram), and an email address to help potential clients get in contact with SJ Fitness. The social media links open to a new tab for easier navigation. 
  - The footer is valuable for the gym business as it allows prospective clients to follow them on social media and to get in touch about new memberships. It is also valuable for the user as it directs them to the social media sites and gives them an email point of contact to ask any questions prior to signing up via the 'Join Us' page.

- __The Pricing Page__

  - The pricing page has a brief explanation at the top of the page below the navigation bar which also contains a hyperlink to the Join Us page so that the user can immediately navigate to sign up.

  - The pricing page is then split into three columns which represents the different membership tiers and their respecting monthly cost. The information on different tiers is concisely summarised via the use of bullet points so that the user is not overloaded with too much information regarding the membership types.
  - The membership tiers and bullet points are positioned in such a way that it is clear to see what is omitted as the pricing tier decreases which makes comparison of membership tiers easier for the user. This is also a strategy to increase the gym's revenue by convincing prospective clients to sign up for the top tier as they can see that the top ties does provide more for their money when comparing membership options.
